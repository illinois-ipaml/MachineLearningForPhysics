Electron velocities in a wire, stock prices in the stock market, and traffic congestion on a highway are all examples of time-dependent random processes. To understand such systems, scientists and engineers make use of the Markov chain, a stochastic process model developed by the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov in the 1900s.\n",

The Markov chain is specified by the probabilities of transitioning from state 𝐴 to state 𝐵, i.e., from today’s weather 𝐴 to tomorrow’s weather 𝐵, which we call $P(A \\rightarrow B)$  For example, maybe we think that 50% of the time a cloudy day leads to a rainy day, so that $P(\\textrm{cloudy } \\rightarrow \\textrm{ rainy})=0.5$  And maybe we believe that 75% of the time a sunny day is followed by another sunny day, so that $𝑃(\\textrm{ sunny } \\rightarrow \\textrm{sunny}) =0.75$  Once we have defined all these transition probabilities we have made a Markov chain such as the one below."

    "Here we will discuss how to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to compute expectation values.  In statistics, we study the properties of random variables $x$ and their probability distributions $P(x)$.  We often care about computing expectation values of functions of the random variable such as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\langle f(x) \\rangle = \\sum_x f(x) P(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the probability distribution $P(x)$ can be very complicated and difficult to sample efficiently. In this case, we can use Markov chains to represent the probability distribution $P(x)$.   It is possible to pick the transition probabilities of the Markov chain so that the chain’s equilibrium probability distribution is the desired probability distribution $P(x)$. Once we have a correctly defined Markov chain, we can sample it to obtain a set of sampled states $x_1,x_2,...,x_T$.  These sampled states can be used to estimate expectation values in the following way\n",

However, you should be clear on the distinction between Monte Carlo and Markov chains. Monte Carlo methods are ways to evaluate integrals using random numbers. Markov chains are used to sample complicated probability distributions. When Monte Carlo is used to integrate a probability distribution specified by a Markov chain, then it is called Markov Chain Monte Carlo.\n",

    "### Metropolis Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo is the Metropolis algorithm. This was the first MCMC algorithm developed. It was proposed in 1953 by Edward Teller, Nicholas Metropolis, and others at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico during the early days of scientific computing. Teller and his physics colleagues were interested in using MCMC to calculate the thermodynamic properties of a weakly interacting classical gas, which was very difficult to calculate analytically. Impressively, more than half a century after its introduction, Metropolis MCMC is still in wide use today in many areas of science, engineering, and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Metropolis algorithm samples a Markov chain by proposing moves between states, which are then either accepted or rejected according to a specific criterion. These proposed moves are chosen so that the Markov chain’s transition probabilities give the correct equilibrium distribution4. In general, Metropolis Markov chain sampling of a probability distribution $P(S)$ works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start at a state $𝑆_t$.\n",
    "2. Propose a move to a new state $S'$ based on the current state $S_t$.\n",
    "3. Choose a uniform random number $r$ between 0 and 1.\n",
    "4. If $r<P(S')/P(S_t)$ then accept the proposed move and transition to state $S'$ so that $S_{t+1}=S'$   Otherwise, reject the move and stay at state $S_t$ so that $S_{t+1}=S_t$.\n",
    "5. Increment $t$ and repeat.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Markov chain’s samples $S_1,...S_{T_{max}}$ are then used to estimate expectation values $\\langle f(S) \\rangle$ in the way  discussed in the previous section. We will use this general Metropolis MCMC framework to sample the Boltzmann distribution, an important probability distribution in thermal physics.\n",

We are perpetually surrounded by a heat bath of $\\approx 10^{27}$ particles whizzing around us. The black-body radiation we receive from the sun is in thermal equilibrium with the Earth’s surface. The phases of matter we see and interact with every day, such as liquid water, gaseous oxygen, or solid iron, are all described by the physics of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Physical systems that are in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath obey the laws of statistical mechanics. Heat baths are large physical systems that are assumed to be at a constant temperature $T$. A small system put in contact with a heat bath is able to exchange energy with the heat bath so that it also stays at the same temperature.\n"
