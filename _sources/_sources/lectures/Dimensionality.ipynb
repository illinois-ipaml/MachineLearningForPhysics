    "Both PCA and FA implicitly assume that the data is approximately sampled from a multidimensional Gaussian. PCA then finds the principal axes of the the resulting multidimensional ellipsoid, while FA is based on a model for how the original data is generated from the latent variables.  Specifically, FA seeks latent variables that are uncorrelated unit Gaussians and allows for different noise levels in each feature, while assuming that this noise is uncorrelated with the latent variables.  PCA does not distinguish between \"signal\" and \"noise\" and implicitly assumes that the large eigenvalues are more signal-like and small ones more noise-like.\n",

In practice, FA decomposition is more expensive and requires an iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm.  You should normally try both, but prefer the simpler PCA when the results are indistinguishable."
