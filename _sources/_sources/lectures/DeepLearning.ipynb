The main efficiency is a much reduced number of parameters compared to the number of input features, relative to the dense fully connected networks we have seen so far.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we saw in the previous lecture, Neural Networks receive an input (a single vector), and transform it through a series of hidden layers. Each hidden layer is made up of a set of neurons, where each neuron is fully connected to all neurons in the previous layer, and where neurons in a single layer function completely independently and do not share any connections. The last fully-connected layer is called the “output layer” and in classification settings it represents the class scores.\n",

        "The fully-connected, feed-forward neural networks we have studied thus far do not scale well to large image data. For example, a modest 200 $\\times$ 200 $\\times$ 3 (x-pixels, y-pixels, 3 colors) image would lead to neurons that have 200 $\\times$ 200 $\\times$ 3 = 120,000 weights. Moreover, we would almost certainly want to have several such neurons, so the parameters would add up quickly! Clearly, this full connectivity is wasteful and the huge number of parameters would quickly lead to overfitting.\n",
