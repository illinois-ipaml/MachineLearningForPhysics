Its existence was confirmed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations based on collisions in the LHC at CERN.\n",

    "On December 10, 2013, two of the physicists, Peter Higgs and François Englert, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their theoretical predictions. Although Higgs's name has come to be associated with this theory, several researchers between about 1964 and 1972 independently developed different parts of it.”\n",
