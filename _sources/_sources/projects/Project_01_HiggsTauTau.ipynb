Its existence was confirmed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations based on collisions in the LHC at CERN.\n",
    "\n",
    "On December 10, 2013, two of the physicists, Peter Higgs and François Englert, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for their theoretical predictions. Although Higgs's name has come to be associated with this theory, several researchers between about 1964 and 1972 independently developed different parts of it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics predicts the existence of a Higgs boson. It was discovered at CERN in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, with contributions to the data analysis in the discovery paper by Neubauer’s research group at Illinois. See this [video](https://youtu.be/__btEwKQB2I?t=1) for more about the central role that the Higgs boson plays in the standard model of particle physics and Illinois researchers' role in its discovery."
