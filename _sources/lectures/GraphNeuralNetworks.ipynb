    "For this notebook, we will use a simple GNN which is the [Graph Convolution Network](https://towardsdatascience.com/graph-convolutional-networks-introduction-to-gnns-24b3f60d6c95) (GCN) layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "- GCN is a specific type of GNN that uses convolutional operations to propagate information between nodes in a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GCNs leverage a localized aggregation of neighboring node features to update the representations of the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GCNs are based on the convolutional operation commonly used in image processing, adapted to the graph domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The layers in a GCN typically apply a graph convolution operation followed by non-linear activation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GCNs have been successful in tasks such as node classification, where nodes are labeled based on their features and graph structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our GNN is defined by stacking three graph convolution layers, which corresponds to aggregating 3-hop neighborhood information around each node (all nodes up to 3 \"hops\" away). In addition, the GCNConv layers reduce the node feature dimensionality to 2, i.e., `34→4→4→2`. Each GCNConv layer is enhanced by a `tanh` non-linearity. We then apply a linear layer which acts as a classifier to map the nodes to 1 out of the 4 possible classes."
