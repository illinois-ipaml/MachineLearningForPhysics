    "## Data Loading (The \"Starving\" GPU)?\n",
    "You've proven the GPU is fast and the PCIe bus is slow. But what about getting data from your disk to your CPU RAM in the first place?\n",
    "Your GPU is **starving**. It's spending all its time waiting for the CPU to load data (like JPEGs or CSVs) from the disk and prepare the next batch. Your 108 SMs (factories) are idle because the \"delivery trucks\" (the CPU) are stuck in traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Fix\": `DataLoader` Knobs\n",
    "When you use `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`, you have two magic knobs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`num_workers=...`**: This is the *most important* knob. Setting `num_workers=8` (or `16`, `32`) launches 8 parallel CPU processes. While your GPU is busy on `batch 1`, these 8 workers are *already loading and preprocessing* `batch 2`, `3`, `4`, etc. This **hides** the data-loading latency. In ICRN, you only have 2 CPUs, so don't make this number above 2. \n",
    "2.  **`pin_memory=True`**: This is a direct hardware optimization. It tells PyTorch to put the CPU-side data in a special \"page-locked\" (or \"pinned\") memory region. This makes the `HtoD` (Host-to-Device) copy over the PCIe bus **significantly faster**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is pinned memory?\n",
    "- Standard memory: By default, host (CPU) memory is \"pageable,\" meaning the operating system can move it to disk to free up physical RAM for other applications. \n",
    "- Pinned memory: When memory is allocated as \"pinned,\" the OS is instructed to lock it in place within physical RAM, creating a stable, predictable memory region. \n",
    "- GPU access: Because the memory is stable and its physical address is guaranteed to be constant, the GPU can use DMA to transfer data directly to and from it without CPU involvement. "
