    "There is no consensus on the precise definitions of data science, machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence. For our purposes, we consider the following definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ___<span style=\"color:violet\">Data Science</span>___ (DS): a cross-disciplinary field that employs scientific approaches, processes, algorithms and systems used to extract meaning and insights from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ___<span style=\"color:violet\">Artificial Intelligence</span>___ (AI): a field of research aiming to develop artificial systems with human-level learning and reasoning abilities, possessing the qualities of intentionality, intelligence and adaptability. \n",
    "\n",
    "* ___<span style=\"color:violet\">Machine Learning</span>___ (ML): a subset of the field of AI which involves algorithms with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. These algorithms learn from data to improve their accuracy, adaptability and utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "_<span style=\"color:LightGreen\">A little ML history</span>_: Arthur Samuel is an American computer scientist who is credited for coining the term, “machine learning” with his research in computer systems at UIUC (he initiated the [ILLIAC project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILLIAC)) then at IBM where he developed the first checkers program on IBM's first commercial computer in 1959. Robert Nealey, a self-proclaimed checkers master, played the game on an IBM 7094 computer in 1962, and he lost to the computer. Compared to what can be done today, this feat seems trivial, but it’s considered a major milestone in the field of artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ___<span style=\"color:violet\">Artificial neural networks</span>___ (ANNs): comprised of node layers, containing an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node, or artificial neuron, connects to another and has an associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network by that node. \n",
    "\n",
    "* ___<span style=\"color:violet\">Deep Learning</span>___ (DL): a subset of ML in which artificial neural networks adapt and learn from large datasets. The “deep” in deep learning is just referring to the number of layers in a neural network. A neural network that consists of more than three layers—which would be inclusive of the input and the output—can be considered a deep learning algorithm or a deep neural network. A neural network that only has three layers is just a basic neural network. You can think of deep learning as \"scalable machine learning\" that eliminates some of the human intervention required (through flexible frameworks) and enables the use of larger data sets to continually improve the model performance.

    "<span style=\"color:Violet\">Supervised learning</span>, also known as supervised machine learning, is where machines are taught by example. It is defined by its use of labeled datasets to train algorithms to classify new data or predict outcomes accurately. As input data is fed into the model, the model adjusts its weights until it has been fitted appropriately. This occurs as part of the cross validation process to ensure that the model avoids overfitting or underfitting. Supervised learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM)."

This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to reduce the complexity of a model, to improve the performance of a learning algorithm, or to make it easier to visualize the data."

However, unlike supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a dataset that contains both labeled and unlabeled data. Semi-supervised learning is particularly useful when there is a large amount of unlabeled data available, but it’s too expensive or difficult to label all of it. "
